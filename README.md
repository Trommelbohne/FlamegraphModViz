Flamegraph Modular Visualization for Splunk

The Flamegraph App was developed by Nicolas Dohrendorf (Dohrendorf_Consist @ answers.splunk.com) this visualization is released under Apache 2.0 License. 
          It is based on the D3 Adaptation of the Flamegraph visualization, developed by Martin Spier, released also under Apache Version 2.0 
          License, which in turn was based upon the original Flamegraph visulization by Brendan Gregg and released under CDDL Version 1.0.

License information is available in the "About & License Info" dash and in the README folder of the viz_flamegraph_app.
